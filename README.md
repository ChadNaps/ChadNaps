# About Me
Hey there, my name is Chad. I've been interested in tech my entire life and recently have been able to put my full focus on developing my professional skills.
I'm very interested in building applications and services that have a real impact on people's lives. My primary focus is currently on web development, web
services, and server technologies. I'm currently pretty new to coding, but I'm incredibly passionate about improving and building interesting new tools with my
skills.
